.SH DESCRIPTION
.B organize-includes
resolves quoted
.B #include
paths using the given include directories and rewrites them to be relative to each source file. By default it also groups and sorts
.B #include
lines according to the built-in profile (or
.B \-p
.I FILE
). Use
.B \-k
to leave include order unchanged.

Add
.I includedir
to the include search path. May be repeated. At least one is required.

.IR FILE .
If omitted, the built-in default profile is used.
.TP
.B \-k \-\-keep\-order
Do not reorder includes (default is to reorder per profile).
.TP
.B \-\-dry\-run
Print what would be changed without modifying files.
.SH PROFILE FILE
The profile file is YAML. Default angle order: other-c++ > famous-c++ > boost > std-c++ > other-c > famous-c > glib > std-c. Top-level keys:
.TP
.B quoted_groups
List of quoted-include group names in output order:
.BR samename ,
.BR samedir ,
.BR parentdir ,
.BR other ,
.BR parentdir_other .
.TP

List of angle-include groups. Each entry has
.B name
