.SH DESCRIPTION
.B organize-includes
resolves quoted
.B #include
paths using the given include directories and rewrites them to be relative to each source file. By default it also groups and sorts
.B #include
lines according to a profile (see
.SM "DEFAULT PROFILE"
below, or
.B \-p
.IR FILE ).
Use
.B \-k
to leave include order unchanged.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-I " includedir"
Add
.I includedir
to the include search path. May be repeated. At least one is required.
.TP
.BI \-p \-\-profile " FILE"
Load include group profile from the YAML file
.IR FILE .
If omitted, the default profile search is used (see
.SM "DEFAULT PROFILE" ).
.TP
.B \-k \-\-keep\-order
Do not reorder includes (default is to reorder per profile).
.TP
.B \-\-dry\-run
Print what would be changed without modifying files.
.SH DEFAULT PROFILE
When reordering without
.BR \-p ,
a profile file is sought in this order (first existing wins):
.RS
.PD 0
.IP 1. 4
Current directory
.I .includes.yaml
.IP 2. 4
Home
.I .includes.yaml
.IP 3. 4
Home
.I .config/organize-includes/default.yaml
.PD
.RE
Home is
.B $HOME
on Linux/macOS and
.B %USERPROFILE%
on Windows. If none exist, the built-in profile is used.
.SH PROFILE FILE
The profile file is YAML. Built-in angle order: other-c++ > famous-c++ > boost > std-c++ > other-c > famous-c > glib > std-c. Top-level keys:
.TP
.B quoted_groups
List of quoted-include group names in output order:
.BR samename ,
.BR samedir ,
.BR parentdir ,
.BR other ,
.BR parentdir_other .
.TP
.B angle_groups
List of angle-include groups. Each entry has
.B name
(optional) and either
.B prefixes
(list of path prefixes) or
.B match
(one of
.BR no_ext_h ,
.BR std_c_dirs ,
.BR other_cpp ,
.BR other_c ,
.BR other ).
See
.I example/default.yaml
in the source tree.
.SH EXIT STATUS
0 on success. 1 on invalid options, missing include dirs, profile load error, or I/O error.
