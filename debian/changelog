organize-includes (0.0.3) testing; urgency=medium

  * Add -r/--recursive option to scan -I directories recursively.
  * Add -J/--include-rec option to add include directories recursively.
  * Add -n/--relative-name option to rewrite include paths relative to source file.
  * Change default behavior: only reorder includes by default, don't rewrite paths.
    Use -n to also rewrite paths to be relative to source file directory.

organize-includes (0.0.1) testing; urgency=medium

  * Initial release.
  * Update #include paths to be relative; reorder and group includes per YAML
    profile (default). Use -k/--keep-order to skip reordering.
  * -p/--profile FILE to load profile; default search: ./.includes.yaml,
    ~/.includes.yaml, ~/.config/organize-includes/default.yaml (then built-in).
  * Tag-first angle group logic: claiming groups (prefixes, no_ext_h, std_c_dirs)
    vs other_c/other_cpp by extension when unclaimed. Subgroup by top-level dir.
  * Quoted groups: samename, samedir, parentdir, other, parentdir_other.
  * Debian packaging (native source format), man page, bash completion.
  * Makefile: dist, release, release-force (changelog-driven release notes).
